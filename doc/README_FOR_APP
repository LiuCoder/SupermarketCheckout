SupermarketCheckout is an online marketplace selling only three products:

|Product code|Name|Price|
|FR1|Fruit tea|£ 3.11|
|SR1|Strawberries|£ 5.00|
|CF1|Coffee|£11.23|

The supermarket offers some buy-one-get-one-free offers, as well as discounts for bulk purchases.

The most interesting part of the API is the checkout. The interface looks like this:

co = Checkout.new
co.scan(item)
co.scan(item)
Price = co.total

Items can be scanned in any order, and the total will reflect any promotions or discounts currently available.
